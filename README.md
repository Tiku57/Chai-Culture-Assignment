## 📖 Overview

This project is a premium "Coming Soon" landing page for **Chai Culture**, a brand bringing the royal tradition of Indian chai to the world. 

The goal was to translate the brand's vision—**"Brew the Royal Tradition"**—into a digital experience that feels authentic, elegant, and high-end. The page features a "Royal Dark Mode" aesthetic, mobile responsiveness, and a simulated email capture form.
