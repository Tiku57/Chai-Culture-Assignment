# Chai Culture - "Coming Soon" Landing Page

## 📖 Overview

This project is a premium "Coming Soon" landing page for **Chai Culture**, a brand bringing the royal tradition of Indian chai to the world. 

The goal was to translate the brand's vision—**"Brew the Royal Tradition"**—into a digital experience that feels authentic, elegant, and high-end. The page features a "Royal Dark Mode" aesthetic, mobile responsiveness, and a simulated email capture form.

🎨 Design Choices
(As requested in the assignment)

Visual Identity: I anchored the design in a "Royal Dark Mode" aesthetic. Using a deep brown/black radial gradient creates a cinematic spotlight effect that allows the gold accents to pop, simulating the contrast of gold jewelry on dark velvet.

Typography: I paired Playfair Display for headings to evoke tradition and luxury, with Lato for body text to ensure modern legibility on mobile devices.

Technical Execution: I built this using pure HTML, CSS, and JS to demonstrate mastery of core web technologies without relying on heavy frameworks. I utilized a "Glassmorphism" effect for the main card to give it depth and a modern feel while keeping the content legible. The layout is fully responsive, stacking vertically on mobile with adjusted padding for touch targets.
